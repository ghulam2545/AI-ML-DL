# Medical Image Analysis

## Overview

This project is a deep learning-based Pneumonia Detection system. It utilizes a convolutional neural network (CNN) to analyze chest X-ray images and classify them as signs of pneumonia or being normal. The model is trained on a large dataset of labeled X-ray images and can be used to assist in the early diagnosis of pneumonia.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow, Keras API
- NumPy
- Matplotlib (for visualization)
- Gradio (for user interface)

## Dataset

This project uses a dataset of chest X-ray images for training and testing the pneumonia detection model. The dataset can be obtained from kaggle.

Dataset URL: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/paultimothymooney/chest-xray-pneumonia

## Usage

- Run the `training.py` script to train the deep learning model on the dataset. You can modify hyperparameters and model architecture in this script.
- Save the trained model for later use.
- Run the `user_interface.py` script to look at UI interface and upload image for making prediction.
